Practicing ML algorithms on various Kaggle Datasets

<p> In the 2nd notebook file, suv dataset, the accuracy increased by 20% by using Standard Scaler</p>
## Titanic Dataset
Famous Kaggle competition using Titanic Dataset, where we predict whether a set of passengers will survivve on the titanic ship.

## In-class Kaggle competition
Given a suv-dataset, where the objective is to predict whether a person buys a suv car given his income,age,expenses and other information. As it's a binary classification task I applied various algorithms after Data-Preprocessing,Explorartory-Data-Analysis,Feature-Engineering etc. Obtained top-10 rank among 200+ students.This competition was taught me a lot of things that I wasn't aware of.
